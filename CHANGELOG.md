## v0.5.26:

* Bug     : Added mq\_ensure\_running resource to replace upstart check which
            was causing issues on IPv6 enabled hosts. ~ Jordan Hagan

## v0.5.24:
* Bug     : Fix the `attribute_driven_domain` to avoid undeploying OSGi deployables every secodn run.
* Change  : Append versions to the name of OSGi components rather than storing the version on the
            file system in a file.
* Enhance : Don't require the url parameter in the `glassfish_deployable` LWRP as it is only required
            for the deploy action.
* Enhance : Add the ability to hook into the configuration of domains in `attribute_driven_domain` recipe
            by adding recipes to include before and after a domain is configured.
* Bug     : Stop trying to undeploy non-existent resources when server is not upa at start of chef run.

## v0.5.22:
* Change  : Replace the use of cutlery's notifying_action with Chef 11's use_inline_resources method.
* Bug     : Ensure that changes to custom resources are updated on the glassfish server if required.

## v0.5.20:
* Bug     : Ensure terse and echo flags are correctly passed to asadmin command.
* Fix     : Ensure that alternative domain paths are supported.
* Change  : Prefer new notification syntax.
* Change  : Avoid downloading remote artifacts (deployables, libraries and base install) if they will not
            actually be used by adding some not_if guards.

## v0.5.18:
* Change  : Attempting to redeploy the glassfish server in to a directory while an existing service is currently
            running results in an error in usermod "usermod: user glassfish is currently logged in". Change the
            default attributes for the home directory so that glassfish is always installed to a fixed location
            to avoid this scenario in the future.
* Change  : Support file:// urls in `glassfish_deployable` LWRP.
* Change  : Avoid checking for port availability when creating the domain.
* Change  : Rework the deployable so that the non-osgi components will store the version information as part
            of the name. This avoids the scenario where redeploying the same application with a different
            version could undeploy the existing application but fail to deploy the new version. The new approach
            will enable the old version only when the new deployable successfully deploys.

## v0.5.16:
* Change  : Stop using LWRPs to gather the scan the list of resources to delete in the `attribute_driven_domain`
            recipe and instead execute the code inline. Refactor the asadmin library to make it easier to
            implement this functionality.

## v0.5.14:
* Change  : Extract the utility code out into the 'cutlery' cookbook.

## v0.5.12:
* Bug     : Fix regression where properties were not escaping the ':' or '=' characters correctly.

## v0.5.10:
* Enhance : Set umask to 0700 for services.
* Enhance : Escape a more complete set of shell characters when escaping properties. Identified by Robin Wenglewski.
* Change  : Support specification of the library_type in the extra_libraries section while evaluating the
            `attribute_driven_domain` recipe. Submitted by Robin Wenglewski.
* Change  : Make glassfish user a system user.
* Bug     : Ensure all services have the status flag enabled.
* Bug     : Stop starting the glassfish service multiple times in the `glassfish_domain` LWRP and remove duplicate
            actions that caused issues in later versions of chef and how it interacted with upstart services.
* Change  : Upgrade to the 3.1.2.2 version of Glassfish. There was several crippling bugs in the 3.1.2 version.
* Bug     : Fix the guard in the `glassfish_property` LWRP so it will not execute if not needed.
* Bug     : Fix bug that prevented the deletion of historic web_env_entries.
* Bug     : Fix bug due to looking for web_env_entries in osgi deployables. Resulted in errors in glassfish log.
* Bug     : Ensure that the sort key if any is passed to the blend_search_results_into_node method
* Bug     : Avoid attempting to delete the list file if it does not exist. Bug can be expressed when glassfish is
            installed but not running or the domain does not exist.
* Enhance : Add some default JVM options. (-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 and -Djava.awt.headless=true)
* Enhance : Default to not setting the server name in HTTP response by defaulting the product.name system property.
* Enhance : Expand the realm_types parameter of the domain to support chained configs, flags options in configuration.

## v0.5.8:

* Change  : Remove extra_libraries parameter from the `glassfish_domain` LWRP and replace it's use in the
            `attribute_driven_domain` recipe with uses of the `glassfish_library` LWRP.
* Enhance : Add a `glassfish_library` LWRP that can add and remove libraries of various types to the instance.
* Change  : Update the `attribute_driven_domain` recipe to use the keys;
            - 'admin_objects' rather than 'admin-objects'
            - 'jaas_context' rather than 'jaas-context'
            - 'assign_groups' rather than 'assign-groups'
* Enhance : Update the `glassfish_secure_admin` LWRP to immediately restart the service if invoked.
* Enhance : In the `attribute_driven_domain` recipe, delete sub-components that are no longer present in the node
            configuration. The sub-components include things such as resources, realms, pools, deployables etc.
* Bug     : Ensure that the delete action on the `glassfish_custom_resource` LWRP actually executes.
* Enhance : Add returns parameter to the `glassfish_asadmin` LWRP that is directly applied to underlying bash resource.
* Enhance : Pass through the ignore_failure flag on the `glassfish_asadmin` resource to the underlying resource.
* Enhance : Add in a `search_driven_domain` recipe to simplify the collection of data for the
            `attribute_driven_domain` recipe.
* Change  : Make jaas_context optional in the `glassfish_auth_realm` LWRP. Submitted By Adrian Stanila.
* Change  : Use default_action DSL rather than constructor to specify default actions for LWRPs. This means the plugin
            requires Chef v0.10.10 or higher.
* Bug     : Fix the usage of the enabled flag in several resource centric LWRPs. Submitted By Adrian Stanila.
* Bug     : Fix the usage of the debug flag in the javamail resource LWRP.
* Bug     : Fix the usage of the target flag in several resource centric LWRPs. Ensure the guard conditions pass the
            correct target flag. Submitted By Adrian Stanila.
* Bug     : Remove obsolete target flag from jdbc_connection_pool, connector_connection_pool, resource_adapter LWRPs.

## v0.5.6:

* Change  : Rename the attribute tree used to define javamail resources in the `glassfish::attribute_driven_domain`
            recipe from `javamail-resources` to `javamail_resources`.
* Change  : Cache the deployable and deployment plan using the 'version' attribute on the `glassfish_deployable`
            LWRP rather than the basename of the URL as the url may not necessarily be unique.
* Enhance : Make the the 'version' attribute on the `glassfish_deployable` LWRP optional and derive it from the url
            if not specified.

## v0.5.5:

* Bug     : Fix the version checking in the `glassfish_deployable` LWRP that had an extra brace.

## v0.5.4:

* Bug     : Revert the default the value of `node['openmq']['extra_libraries']` to be an empty hash as simplifies
            attribute merges and restores compatibility with the v0.0.45 of cookbook.
* Change  : Update the attribute_driven_domain recipe so that domain takes  a hash for the 'extra_libraries'
            configuration to make it easy to merge attribute data from multiple sources.

## v0.5.3:

* Enhance : Add the a LWRP: `glassfish_javamail_resource`.

## v0.5.2:

* Enhance : Ensure non properties are supported in "properties" parameter passed to various resources.

* Bug     : Replace init.d script with upstart script to eases service management.
* Bug     : Fix failure with mq LWRP's destroy action resulting from incorrect provider specified.

## v0.4.49:

* Bug     : Fix bug introduced in v0.4.48 relating to how the minimum memory is set.
* Enhance : Abort the init script if it fails to start up for "too long" (Currently 60s).

* Enhance : Support the unset action on the `glassfish_web_env_entry` resource.
* Change  : Convert the following resources to using more strongly typed attributes; `glassfish_web_env_entry`,
            `glassfish_property`, `glassfish_auth_realm`, `glassfish_jdbc_connection_pool`, `glassfish_jdbc_resource`.
* Bug     : Ensure that the glassfish domain is restarted if a a support library is added.

* Enhance : Add a `glassfish_secure_admin` resource that either enables or disables remote administration.
* Bug     : Ensure unzip package is installed otherwise the initial install will fail.
* Bug     : Fix bug where a failure during package install could leave the system in an unrecoverable state as the
            partial install directory existed.
* Change  : Use create_if_missing when downloading resources.
* Change  : Disable the xpowered-by header by default.

            parameters passed to the resource.
* Change  : Move the creation of domains directory into the `glassfish_domain` resource.
* Change  : Expand the 'schema' key in MQ destination configurations in the `glassfish_mq_destination` resource rather
            than the `glassfish_mq` resource.
* Change  : The username for the glassfish_mq_destination now defaults to 'imqadmin'.
* Change  : The base directory in which the OpenMQ instances are stored is now retrieved via the
            `node['openmq']['var_home']` property rather than being configured on the resource or in the domain
            definition.
* Enhance : Several changes to the code style of the cookbook and steps to start using foodcritic to check cookbook.
* Enhance : Add some basic documentation to the README.

## v0.0.44:

* Enhance : Support the deployment of OSGi bundles using the 'glassfish_deployable' resource by setting the
            type parameter to ':osgi'. OSGi bundles are deployed prior to the realms or any other commands
             being executed as they can be the modules providing the capability.
* Enhance : Allow the configuration of the set of login modules in the 'glassfish_domain' resource and the
            associated attribute driven recipes.

## v0.0.43:

* Change  : Update the `glassfish_mq` resource so that it is necessary to explicitly specify the jmx admins and
            monitors rather than relying on a search in a 'users' data bag search.

## v0.0.42:

* Change  : Split the managed_domains into two attribute driven recipes. One to create domains and one to create brokers.
* Change  : Change the name of the attribute used to drive the creation of the domains to `glassfish.domains`.

## v0.0.41:

* Change  : Remove the searching of other nodes to locate the OpenMQ topics, queues, users and access control rules as
            that is a business specific policy that has no place in a generic cookbook.

## v0.0.40:

* Enhance : Support the logging_properties attribute on the domain resource and in the managed_domains recipe. This
            makes it possible to configure the logging.properties file generated for the Glassfish application server.

## v0.0.39:

* Enhance : Support the logging_properties attribute being mapped from the managed_domains recipe.

## v0.0.38:

* Enhance : Support the logging_properties attribute on the mq resource. This makes it possible to configure the
            logging.properties file generated for the OpenMQ server.
* Bug     : Explicitly configure the OpenMQ server logging settings. This avoids the scenario where the stomp bridge
            log can grow without bounds.

## v0.0.37:

* Bug     : Stop the OpenMQ server restarting every chef run. Resulting from both the server and the chef rewriting the
            config file. Now chef will only rewrite the file if some of the settings have changed.

## v0.0.36:

* Enhance : Initial convergence of OpenMQ server will no longer require a restart of the server.

## v0.0.35:

* Enhance : Initial convergence of glassfish application server will no longer require a restart if extra libraries are
            specified.

## v0.0.34:

* Change  : Default to supplying the "force" flag during application deployment.
* Bug     : Stop the Glassfish application server restarting when a web env entry or jndi resource is updated.

            the server is up and listening to expected ports.
* Enhance : Support null values in web env entries.
* Bug     : Fix escaping of string values in custom jndi resources.

## v0.0.32:

* Initial release
